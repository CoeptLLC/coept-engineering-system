## Why Use an Engineering System

Software engineering teams are complex systems. Factors such as imperfect memory, additions and removals of team members, and shifting business priorities introduce complexity into the life of a software engineering team. A properly designed engineering system is essential to mitigate this complexity.

The fundamental goal of an engineering system is **consistency**. Quality (perfect or otherwise) is not the immediate goal; rather, quality is the result of the _combination_ of a consistently applied engineering system and the team's dedication to **continuous improvement**. That is, the software engineering team must first ensure absolutely consistent adherence to this engineering system in order to make quality possible, and then the software engineering team must evolve this engineering system to adapt to the changing needs of the software engineering team over time and to actually achieve quality.

This system maintains all records of its evolution in the `docs/decisions` folder. The shared Coept Engineering System (CES) on which this system is based maintains all records of its evolution in the dedicated `docs/decisions/ces` subfolder, allowing forked repositories to forward-integrate future CES enhancements.

## How to Use the Coept Engineering System

1. Review all the architecture decision records (ADRs) in the `docs/decisions/ces` folder to understand the rationale behind the technical decisions made by the CES.
2. Review all the system-specific ADRs in the `docs/decisions` folder to understand the rationale behind the technical decisions made by the software engineering team in your current system.
